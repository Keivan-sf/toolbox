# debounce

debounce returns a function which will call the callback function provided to it, only if
a certain delay is past since its last call. Useful for seachboxes, buttons, etc.

### Import

```typescript copy
import { debounce } from '@fullstacksjs/toolbox';
```

### Signature

```typescript copy
function debounce<F extends (...args: any[]) => any>(
  cb: F,
  delay: number,
  immediate: boolean = false,
): (...args: Parameters<F>) => void {}
```

### Examples

`immediate` flag being false as default:
```typescript copy
function execute(id: number) {
    console.log(id);
}

const debounced = debounce(execute, 1000);

debounced(1);
debounced(2);
debounced(3);
debounced(4);
debounced(5); // will log 5 after 1 second
```

`immediate` flag being true:
```typescript copy
function execute(id: number) {
    console.log(id);
}

const debounced = debounce(execute, 1000 , true);

debounced(1); // will log 1 immediately
debounced(2);
debounced(3);
debounced(4);
debounced(5); // will log 5 after 1 second
```

if `immediate` is true, the function will always execute the callback if the
delay is passed since the last time it was called.
